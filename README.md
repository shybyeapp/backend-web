**Our mission** is to help individuals overcome social anxiety and loneliness by
gamifying primarily in-person social interactions through a variety of fun
social challenges

ShyBye was initially created over the span of *four days* during the 2022
"[GDI Virtual Hackathon](https://girldevelopit.com/virtual-hackathon/): Hack for
Health!" and won the "On Our Phone Tomorrow!" award

Made with &hearts; by all [our awesome contributors](https://shybye.netlify.app/about)!
