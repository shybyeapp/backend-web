### ‚ö†Ô∏è Archived content
On **13 January 2023**, it was decided to migrate resources away from
maintaining and developing ShyBye's own backend infrastructure in favor of
utilizing *Firebase*-provided utilities (database, authentication, hosting,
etc.) As a result, this repository is archived and no longer maintained.

**Our mission** is to help individuals overcome social anxiety and loneliness by
gamifying primarily in-person social interactions through a variety of fun
social challenges

ShyBye was initially created over the span of *four days* during the 2022

Health!" and won the "On Our Phone Tomorrow!" award

Made with &hearts; by all [our awesome contributors](https://shybye.app/about)!
